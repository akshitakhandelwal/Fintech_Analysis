## 🧠 Problem Statement

> **"Analyze user behavior, transaction trends, and credit utilization in a fintech platform to help business and product teams identify top spenders, improve engagement, and reduce failed payments."**

## 🗃️ Data Model

The relational database was designed using **MySQL**, with the following tables:

- `users`: User details including name, city, and income
- `accounts`: User accounts with wallet balance and credit limits
- `transactions`: Financial transactions including amount, status, type, and time
- `loans`: Loan records with principal, interest rate, and tenure
- `repayments`: Repayment history for each loan
- `credit_scores`: Credit rating per user

Synthetic data was generated using Python (`Faker`, `random`, and `MySQL Connector`).
